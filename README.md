# cinco_game

I deleveloped this game in C++ during my 4-th year of high-school.

The cinco game is similar to the tris game. 
There are however two main differences:

1) the number ajacent checkers needed for a user to win are 5 and not 3.
2) the board size is nxn, n > 5.

Two different modes are available:

1) 1 vs 1
2) 1 vs AI 

AI is based on a very-simple, yet very powerful heuristic. Can you beat it? (-:
